# Generalized Zero Shot Learning via Aligned Variational Autoencoders

See https://github.com/edgarschnfld/CADA-VAE-PyTorch for the original implementation!

Implementation of the paper "Generalized Zero- and Few-Shot Learning via Aligned Variational Autoencoders" for internal Project


We extend the described functionality in the Paper https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.01784.pdf with Episodic Training and semantic information that went through a previous Variational Encoder Model to extract a Contrastive Embedding of the before tabular semantic class descriptions.
